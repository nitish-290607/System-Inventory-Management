# System-Inventory-Management
MainFrame.java is the main GUI window of the Inventory Management System. It uses Swing with a modern flat design, sidebar navigation, and CardLayout for switching panels (Dashboard, Items, Inventory, Reports). It customizes colors, fonts, and buttons, integrates backend InventoryService, and includes an exit dialog.
